# Jadhav Lab Codes
 Code repositories from Jadhav Lab
 This repository has all my code from the jadhav lab.  Right now there are three projects
 
  1. Claires project: olfactory guided T maze task
  
  2. FMR1 project: will be the alternation W maze with a shift of the home arm                 M
      but also a social W maze wherein the naimals have to poke the correspinding arms for the W
      
  3. DG-GABAa5 KO animals: this is an abbreviated version of the radial arm maze, wherein there are 4 outbound arms and a single
      home arm.  The single out arm maze is shifted each time.
      
 
 These code bases often have dependencies and query hardcoded filepaths.  They are not intended for general use by any means.
